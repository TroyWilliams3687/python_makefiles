# Information

# This is the prototype for the main Makefile in Python code repositories. It
# will make use of the `Makefile.python` to deal with the majority of python
# functionality that the repos will require. It will also help to make the main
# Makefile clean and contain only specific things that are required for the
# individual repository.


# -----------
# Variables

# The location to the python installation to use - we have an environment
# variable set with the correct path. The variable is set in `~/.bashrc` and
# will point to something like python=`~/opt/python_3.9.5/bin`

PYPATH?=$(python)

# define the binary to use
PY?=$(PYPATH)/python3.9

include Makefile.python
include Makefile.python.build  # Optional
